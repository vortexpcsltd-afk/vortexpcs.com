                When you place an order through our website, you are making an offer to purchase products from us. 
                We will send you an order confirmation email acknowledging receipt of your order. This does not 
                constitute acceptance of your order. A contract between us comes into existence when we send you 
                a dispatch confirmation email.

              <h3 className="mb-3">3.2 Pricing</h3>

                All prices are displayed in British Pounds (Â£) and include VAT at the current rate (unless otherwise 
                stated). We reserve the right to change prices at any time, but changes will not affect orders for

                configuration changes may not be possible. Component availability and compatibility is verified 
                before dispatch confirmation.

                may be dispatched within 1-3 working days. Delivery estimates are provided at checkout and are

                Under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013, you have the right to cancel your order within 
                14 days of receiving the product without giving any reason. To exercise this right, you must 
                inform us of your decision using a clear statement (email or letter).

              <h3 className="mb-3">5.2 Custom-Built PCs</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                Custom-built PCs made to your specification may not qualify for the standard 14-day cancellation 
                right, as they are bespoke products. However, your statutory rights under the Consumer Rights 
                Act 2015 (faulty goods, not as described) remain unaffected.

              <h3 className="mb-3">5.3 Return Conditions</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                Returned products must be in their original condition, unused, and in original packaging. You are 
                responsible for the cost of returning items unless the product is faulty or not as described. 
                We recommend using tracked delivery for returns.
              </p>

              <h3 className="mb-3">5.4 Refunds</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Refunds will be processed within 14 days of receiving the returned product. We will refund the 
                price paid for the product and standard delivery charges (if you cancelled the entire order). 
                Refunds will be made to the original payment method.

              <h3 className="mb-3">6.1 VortexPCs Warranty</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                All complete PC systems built by VortexPCs come with a comprehensive warranty covering parts 
                and labour. Warranty periods vary by product and are specified at the time of purchase (typically 
                1-3 years for complete systems).
              </p>

              <h3 className="mb-3">6.2 Component Warranties</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                Individual components are covered by manufacturer warranties, which range from 1-5 years depending 
                on the component. We will facilitate warranty claims with manufacturers on your behalf.
              </p>

              <h3 className="mb-3">6.3 Consumer Rights Act 2015</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                Your statutory rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 are not affected by our warranty. Goods 
                must be as described, fit for purpose, and of satisfactory quality. If products are faulty within 
                30 days, you may be entitled to a full refund. Within 6 months, products are presumed faulty at 
                the time of delivery unless we can prove otherwise.
              </p>

              <h3 className="mb-3">6.4 Warranty Exclusions</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Warranties do not cover damage caused by misuse, accidents, unauthorised modifications, liquid 
                damage, or normal wear and tear. Opening PC cases does not void warranty, but damage caused by 
                user-installed components or improper handling is not covered.
