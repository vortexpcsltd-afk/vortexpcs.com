// ===== P0: CPU Bottleneck Warning Variations =====
const cpuBottleneckWarnings = [
  "⚠️ CPU upgrade constraint: Your current CPU will bottleneck if you upgrade beyond RTX 4070-class GPU. At 1080p/1440p high-refresh, CPU becomes the limit. Consider CPU+motherboard+RAM upgrade before moving to flagship GPUs.",
  "⚠️ CPU bottleneck alert: Pairing a much stronger GPU (e.g., RTX 4080+) will hit CPU limits in esports/simulation titles. Upgrade ceiling: ~RTX 4070 tier. Beyond that, budget for CPU platform refresh (£400-600 total).",
  "⚠️ Platform limitation: Your CPU is the upgrade bottleneck. GPU improvements beyond mid-tier won't yield proportional gains. Solution: Plan CPU+board+RAM upgrade (£500-700) before next flagship GPU purchase.",
];

// ===== P0: Motherboard/Platform Warning Variations =====
const motherboardGenWarnings = [
  "🔧 Platform heads-up: Your motherboard is PCIe 3.0. Fine now, but limits future Gen5 NVMe upgrades and may bottleneck flagship GPUs slightly (5-8%). When CPU upgrading, consider PCIe 4.0/5.0 board (B650/Z790+).",
  "🔧 Motherboard future-proofing: Current board is last-gen (PCIe 3.0/DDR4). Perfectly functional, but limits next-gen upgrades. When refreshing CPU (2-3 years), step to DDR5 + PCIe 4.0 platform for better longevity.",
  "🔧 Platform obsolescence note: Your chipset is aging (PCIe 3.0 era). Works great now, but newer tech (DDR5, Gen5 NVMe, PCIe 5.0 GPUs) won't be supported. Plan platform migration in 2-3 years when CPU upgrading.",
];

const motherboardDDR4Warnings = [
  "🔧 DDR4→DDR5 timing: You're on DDR4 (fine for now). DDR5 transition makes sense when CPU upgrading (2026-2027). Expect £100-150 premium for DDR5 board + RAM, but gains longevity. Don't rush – DDR4 still strong.",
  "🔧 Memory platform note: DDR4 is mature and stable. DDR5 offers 10-15% gains in CPU-bound tasks but costs more. Transition when your CPU needs upgrading (not before). By 2027, DDR5 will be price-competitive.",
];

// ===== P1: RAM Speed Upgrade Variations =====
const ramSpeedUpgradeVariations = [
  "📊 RAM speed upgrade: DDR4-3200 → DDR5-6000 requires motherboard+CPU change. Not worth it standalone. However, when you do platform upgrade (2-3 years), stepping to DDR5-6000 adds 8-12% CPU performance for £20-30 more. Future-proof choice!",
  "📊 RAM speed note: Current speed is solid. Faster RAM (DDR5) needs full platform swap. Wait until CPU upgrade time, then step to DDR5-6000 CL30 (£80-120 for 32GB). Gain: 10-15% in CPU-heavy tasks. Timing: 2026-2027.",
  "📊 Memory speed path: Upgrading RAM speed alone = poor value (requires new board+CPU). Keep current setup. When platform upgrading, go DDR5-6000+ for future-proofing. Incremental cost: £50-80. Performance: +8-15% in productivity.",
];

// ===== P1: Storage Type Upgrade Variations =====
const storageTypeUpgradeVariations = [
  "💽 Storage upgrade trigger: SATA→NVMe Gen4 cuts load times 40-60% (£80-120 for 1TB). Worth it if you do video editing or large file transfers. Gaming: modest 5-10s savings. Install alongside current drive, migrate OS later.",
  "💽 Storage tech upgrade: Your SATA SSD is the bottleneck. NVMe Gen4 (7000MB/s) costs £80-100 for 1TB, saves 30-50s in game loads and drastically speeds creative workflows. Easy upgrade – extra M.2 slot available!",
  "💽 NVMe upgrade path: Gen3→Gen4 NVMe gains 2-3x speed (£90-130 for 1TB). Real-world: faster app launches, quicker file operations. Gaming: minor. Content creation: significant. Upgrade when your workflow justifies it (12-18 months).",

  "💽 Storage Gen4 upgrade: Gen3→Gen4 NVMe doubles speed for £20-30 more (1TB ~£100). Benefit: 20-30s faster in large file transfers, DirectStorage games. Not urgent, but nice-to-have when expanding storage. Future-proof!",
  "💽 Gen4 NVMe timing: Your Gen3 drive is solid. Gen4 offers 2x speed for modest premium. Upgrade trigger: when adding second drive or if doing heavy video work. Cost: £90-120 for 1TB Gen4. Gain: better future game support (DirectStorage).",
];

// ===== P1: Monitor/GPU Sync Warning Variations =====
const monitorGPUSyncWarnings = [
  "🖥️ Monitor bottleneck! Your GPU is overkill for 1080p 60Hz. Upgrade to 1440p 144-165Hz (£250-350) to unlock your card's potential. You're leaving 50-70% performance on the table. This should be your NEXT upgrade – bigger impact than most hardware!",
  "🖥️ Critical: GPU wasted on 1080p! You're bottlenecked by your monitor, not PC. Step to 1440p 144Hz (£280-380) for immediate visual upgrade. Your GPU can push 120+ FPS easily. Biggest bang-for-buck upgrade available – prioritize this!",
  "🖥️ Monitor mismatch: High-end GPU on basic monitor = wasted potential. Upgrade to 1440p 144-165Hz IPS (£300-400) ASAP. Gain: buttery smoothness, better visuals. Your GPU is ready. This is more impactful than any internal component upgrade right now!",
];

const monitorGPUUpgradeSync = [
  "🖥️ Monitor upgrade timing: When you upgrade GPU next (2-3 years), also budget for monitor refresh. If going 4K, add £400-600 for 4K 144Hz. If staying 1440p, consider ultrawide (£500-700). Sync upgrades = better value!",
  "🖥️ Display future-proofing: Your GPU will handle 1440p for years. If upgrading monitor, consider 1440p ultrawide (£450-650) or 4K 144Hz (£500-800). Pair monitor upgrades with GPU refreshes for balanced spending.",
];

// ===== P1: Cooling Upgrade Triggers (not just missing) =====
const coolingUpgradeTriggers = [
  "❄️ Cooling upgrade path: Stock/tower cooler → 240mm AIO gains 10-15°C lower temps, better boost clocks (+100-200MHz sustained). Worth £80-100 if you do long rendering or want quieter operation. Easy installation!",
  "❄️ Cooling improvement: Upgrading to 280/360mm AIO (£100-140) drops temps 15-20°C vs stock, enables better overclocking, and runs quieter. Benefit: sustained boost clocks, component longevity. Upgrade timing: when you want more performance headroom.",
  "❄️ Thermal upgrade trigger: Your cooler is adequate, but AIO upgrade (£90-130) unlocks +5-10% sustained CPU performance in heavy workloads through better thermal headroom. Consider if you do video editing or heavy multitasking.",
];

// ===== P2: Platform Migration Timing =====
const platformMigrationVariations = [
  "🔄 Platform migration roadmap: AM4→AM5 or Intel 12th→14th gen makes sense in 2-3 years when CPU bottlenecks. Expect £500-700 (CPU+board+RAM). Gain: DDR5, PCIe 5.0, 20-30% CPU uplift. Don't rush – current platform has legs!",
  "🔄 Platform refresh timing: Your socket is mature (2-3 gens old). When upgrading CPU next (2026-2027), consider full platform jump vs same-socket upgrade. New platform: +£200-300 but future-proof. Same socket: cheaper but limited headroom.",
  "🔄 Socket migration note: Current platform nearing EOL. Next CPU upgrade = likely platform change (new socket/RAM/board). Budget £600-800 for full refresh vs £250-350 for CPU-only. Benefit: DDR5, modern I/O, better efficiency.",
  "🔄 Platform longevity: You're on last-gen socket. Works great now, but when CPU upgrading (2027+), you'll need motherboard+RAM too. Save accordingly – platform jumps cost 2-3× CPU-only upgrades but last 5-7 years.",
];

// ===== P2: Case Airflow Upgrade Tips =====
const caseAirflowUpgradeVariations = [
  "🌬️ Airflow upgrade tip: Poor case ventilation + high-power build = thermal throttling risk. Add 2-3 intake fans (£30-50 for quality pack). Gain: 5-10°C drop across all components, quieter operation. Easy DIY install!",
  "🌬️ Case cooling note: Your build pushes 400W+. If temps run high, upgrade case fans (3× 120mm intake, £40-60) before replacing cooler. Better airflow = cooler GPU, VRMs, SSD. Bigger impact than you'd think!",
  "🌬️ Thermal optimisation: High-power system benefits from mesh-front case or fan pack upgrade (£50-80). Target: 3 front intake, 2 top/rear exhaust. Drops temps 8-12°C system-wide. Consider before CPU cooler upgrade!",
];

// ===== P2: Dual GPU / Capture Card Guidance =====
const secondaryGPUVariations = [
  "🎥 Streaming setup: If you stream, consider dedicated capture card (Elgato 4K60 Pro, £200-250) or second GPU for encoding. Frees up main GPU for gaming. Your motherboard likely has spare PCIe slot. Check clearance first!",
  "🎥 Content creator tip: Dual GPU (old card for encoding, new for gaming) costs £0 if you keep previous GPU. Install in second PCIe slot for OBS NVENC while gaming on primary. Check PSU wattage and case space!",
  "🎥 Capture hardware: Serious streaming? Dedicated capture card (£150-300) offloads encoding from GPU, better quality, lower latency. Requires free PCIe x4 slot. Alternative: AV.io 4K USB capture (no slot needed, £250).",
];

// ===== P2: Sequential Upgrade Roadmap =====
const sequentialRoadmapVariations = [
  "🗓️ 12-month upgrade roadmap: Now→6mo: Monitor (if needed), RAM capacity. 6-12mo: Storage expansion, case fans. 12-24mo: GPU (if prices drop). 24-36mo: CPU platform refresh. Spread costs, maximize value!",
  "🗓️ Upgrade sequence strategy: Prioritize: 1) Monitor (unlocks GPU), 2) RAM (cheap, immediate gain), 3) Storage (as needed), 4) GPU (when next-gen stable), 5) CPU/platform (when bottlenecked). Sequence matters!",
  "🗓️ Smart upgrade timeline: Year 1: Monitor + RAM if needed. Year 2: GPU when prices normalize post-launch. Year 3: CPU + motherboard + RAM platform jump. Avoids costly mistakes and maximizes component lifespan!",
  "🗓️ Long-term build plan: Your current rig: 2-3 years as-is. First upgrade: GPU (2027). Second: Full platform (2028-2029). Meanwhile: add storage/RAM as needed. This spreads £1500-2000 in upgrades over 4-5 years vs all at once.",
];

// ===== P2: High-Power Build Specific =====
const highPowerBuildVariations = [
  "⚡ High-power build note: 500W+ system. Ensure: quality PSU (80+ Gold minimum), good case airflow (3+ intake fans), AIO cooling for CPU. These aren't optional – thermal/power issues cause instability. You're pushing limits!",
  "⚡ Performance build requirements: Your wattage is serious (600W+). Mandatory: 850W+ PSU with headroom, mesh-front case, strong CPU cooling. Skimping here = crashes, throttling, shortened component life. Budget for proper infrastructure!",
];

// ===== P3: Price Anchoring (link upgrade costs to build value) =====
const priceAnchoredUpgradeVariations = [
  "💰 Budget-friendly upgrade: RAM capacity doubling (£60-80) = ~5-8% of your build cost. Immediate multitasking gains, easy install. Best price-to-performance upgrade available right now!",
  "💰 Smart spending: Monitor upgrade (£250-350) = ~15-20% of build cost but transforms experience. More impactful than GPU step-up at this tier. Prioritize display over internal upgrades!",
  "💰 Value upgrade: Adding 1TB NVMe (£80-100) = <10% of build cost. Cheap insurance vs running out of space. Install alongside current drive, no reinstall needed. Future-proof now!",
];

// ===== P3: Performance Gain Estimates =====
const performanceGainEstimates = [
  "📊 Upgrade impact: DDR4-3200→DDR5-6000 = +10-15% CPU-bound performance (productivity, simulation). Gaming: +5-8% at 1080p, minimal at 4K. Real-world: snappier app launches, faster compiles.",
  "📊 Performance math: Gen3→Gen4 NVMe = 2-3× sequential speed but only 10-20% faster game loads (CPU/decompression limited). Content creation: significant. Casual gaming: minor. Set expectations accordingly!",
  "📊 FPS impact: GPU upgrade (4060→4070) = +30-40% average FPS at 1440p. CPU upgrade (R5→R7) = +15-25% in CPU-heavy titles, minimal in GPU-bound. Know your bottleneck before spending!",
  "📊 Real gains: 240mm→360mm AIO = 8-12°C cooler, +100-200MHz sustained boost clocks = +3-5% multi-core performance in long workloads. Gaming: minimal. Rendering/encoding: noticeable.",
];

// ===== P3: Compatibility Pre-Checks =====
const compatibilityPreChecks = [
  "✅ Compatibility reminder: DDR5 requires new motherboard + CPU (AM5/LGA1700+). Can't mix-and-match with DDR4 platform. Budget full platform refresh, not RAM alone. Check socket support first!",
  "✅ Upgrade pre-check: PCIe 5.0 NVMe needs Gen5-capable board (B650E/X670E/Z790). Gen4 boards won't utilize full speed. Verify chipset before buying flagship SSD. Gen4 is plenty for most users!",
  "✅ Before upgrading: AIO coolers need case clearance (240mm = ~280mm length, 360mm = ~400mm). Check case specs + GPU length. Top-mount may hit RAM. Front-mount may limit GPU. Measure first!",
  "✅ Platform check: Your motherboard max RAM speed (check QVL list). Buying 6400MHz RAM on board capped at 5600MHz = wasted money. Match kit to board capability, not wishful thinking!",
];

// ===== P3: Resale Value Notes =====
const resaleValueNotes = [
  "💵 Resale planning: High-end GPUs hold 60-70% value for 12-18 months, then drop sharply. Sell 3-6 months before new gen launch for best return. Mid-tier cards: 50% at 12mo, 35% at 24mo.",
  "💵 Component depreciation: CPUs hold value well (70% at 2yrs). GPUs depreciate fastest (50% at 18mo). RAM/storage stable (60% at 3yrs). Plan upgrades around resale curves – timing is money!",
  "💵 Upgrade economics: Selling old GPU before new gen launch = recover 65-75% cost. Waiting 6mo post-launch = 45-55%. Early sell + wait for price stabilization = best strategy (patience pays).",
  "💵 Resale tip: Keep original box, receipt, warranty. Adds 10-15% resale value. Flagship GPU 18mo old with box = £600-700 vs £500-550 without. Original packaging signals care, commands premium!",
