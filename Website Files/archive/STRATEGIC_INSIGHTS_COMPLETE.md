## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

```
⚡ 5-Year Total Cost of Ownership: Your Ryzen 7800X3D + RTX 4090
system draws ~570W under load. At 4 hours/day (moderate use),
electricity costs: £0.64/day, £233/year, £1,165 over 5 years...

💡 Efficiency Alternative: A more efficient CPU/GPU combo (~350W total)
would save you £452 over 5 years in electricity alone...
```

### Market Intelligence

```
🇬🇧 UK Market Context: Best UK retailers by category: GPUs - Scan.co.uk
(price match guarantee), Overclockers UK (enthusiast support)...

🛒 Perfect Timing - Black Friday Incoming!: It's November – Black Friday/
Cyber Monday deals in 2-3 weeks! Historical UK data shows: GPUs drop
10-20%, SSDs drop 15-25%...
```

### Future-Proofing Analysis

```
🔮 Build Future-Proofing Score: 87/100 (Grade A) - Your Ryzen 7 7800X3D +
RTX 4090 combination should remain relevant for 5-7 years...

🛠️ Upgrade Path Strategy: When performance starts feeling slow (expected
~5 years), upgrade GPU first (it'll age faster), then CPU 1-2 years later...
```

### Generational Comparisons

```
💡 RTX 4070 vs RTX 3080 (Previous Gen): Similar rasterization, 4070 wins
efficiency (200W vs 320W). RTX 3080 10GB can be found used for £400-500
vs RTX 4070 new at £550-600. If you can find quality 3080 from reputable
seller at £420 or less, it's 90% the performance for 70% the price...
```

### Storage Deep-Dive

```
💡 Gen4 NVMe - The Sweet Spot: You've made the smart choice (5,000-7,500 MB/s).
Gen5 costs 50% more for only 10-15% real-world improvement in games. You can
invest that £40-60 savings into more storage capacity or a better GPU tier...

⚠️ SATA SSD in 2025 Reality Check: SATA SSDs max out at 550 MB/s (13x slower
than Gen4). Boot times: ~25s vs ~8s Gen4. For your main OS/games drive,
spending £10-15 more for 500GB Gen4 NVMe is non-negotiable...
```
