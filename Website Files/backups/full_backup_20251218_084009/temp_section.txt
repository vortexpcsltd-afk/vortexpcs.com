### 16. **Actionable Insights Dashboard**

**Priority: Medium** | **Complexity: Medium**

- **Recommendations Tab** (NEW):
  - Top 5 missing products to source (based on high-demand searches with zero/low inventory)
  - Underperforming categories (high searches, low results/CTR)
  - Quick wins (products to add for immediate impact, low effort/high value)
  - Search term spelling corrections to implement (typo clusters and synonyms)

**Data Sources**:

- `searchQueries`, `zeroResultSearches`, `searchRefinements`
- CMS inventory via `services/cms.ts` (stockLevel/inStock)
- Conversion/CTR metrics from `analytics_events`

**Implementation Notes**:

- UI: AdminPanel → Analytics → “Recommendations” tab with cards and tables
- Logic: Reuse `utils/searchDemandPredictor.ts` + typo detection from Smart Suggestions
- Export: CSV/Excel of recommended items and corrections
