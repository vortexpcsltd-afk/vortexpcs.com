Cost vs fully modular: £10-15 cheaper for functionally identical experience (you never detach main power cables anyway). Smart builders choose semi-modular – all the benefits, minimal cost premium."):l&&e.push("✨ **Fully Modular – Premium Cable Management**: Every single cable detaches, including 24-pin ATX and 8-pin CPU. Benefits: Absolute cleanest builds (custom cable lengths, no visible cables in minimalist cases), easiest motherboard installation (plug in board first, then add cables), simplified troubleshooting (quick disconnect for testing). Cost premium: £10-20 vs semi-modular. Worth it for: Show builds (tempered glass, RGB focus, photography/showcase), extreme SFF builds (custom length cables critical), frequent hardware testers. Overkill for: Standard builds where semi-modular achieves same visual result. My take: Nice-to-have not need-to-have – but if you're already spending £2000+, why not?"),e}export{T as getCompetitiveContext,S as getMarketIntelligence,A as getTCOAnalysis};
