# 🔧 Fix GitHub Pages Deployment Protection Error

## 🚨 Problem

You're getting this error:

```
Branch "master" is not allowed to deploy to github-pages due to environment protection rules.
The deployment was rejected or didn't satisfy other protection rules.
```

## ✅ Solution: Disable GitHub Pages

Since you're using **Vercel** for deployment (not GitHub Pages), you need to disable GitHub Pages in your repository settings.

### Step-by-Step Fix:

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**:

   - Visit: https://github.com/vortexpcsltd-afk/vortexpcs.com

2. **Navigate to Settings**:

   - Click the **Settings** tab in your repository

3. **Find Pages section**:

   - Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
   - Click on **Pages**

4. **Disable GitHub Pages**:

   - Under **Source**, select **"None"** or **"Disabled"**
   - Click **Save**

5. **Verify Vercel is your only deployment**:
   - Your Vercel deployment: https://vortexpcs-3mlutfg6y-vortexpc5.vercel.app/
   - Should be working perfectly ✅

## 🎯 Why This Happened

GitHub Pages was likely enabled automatically when you:

- Pushed to the `master` branch
- Had static files in your repository
- GitHub detected it as a potential static site

But since you're using **Vercel** for deployment, you don't need GitHub Pages.

## ✅ Verification

After disabling GitHub Pages:

1. **Push a test commit**:

   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "test: verify GitHub Pages disabled"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. **Check deployments**:
   - ❌ No GitHub Pages deployment should trigger
   - ✅ Vercel should still deploy automatically
   - ✅ Your site remains accessible at the Vercel URL

## 🚀 Your Current Deployment Setup

- **Platform**: Vercel ✅
- **URL**: https://vortexpcs-3mlutfg6y-vortexpc5.vercel.app/ ✅
- **Auto-deploy**: On every push to master ✅
- **Analytics**: Vercel Analytics enabled ✅
- **Framework**: Vite + React ✅

## 🔧 Alternative: Custom Domain

Once GitHub Pages is disabled, you can:

1. Add a custom domain in Vercel dashboard
2. Point `vortexpcs.com` to Vercel
3. Get automatic HTTPS and CDN

## 💡 Summary

The error is caused by GitHub trying to deploy to GitHub Pages when it shouldn't. Disabling GitHub Pages in repository settings will resolve this while keeping your Vercel deployment working perfectly.

**Action Required**: Disable GitHub Pages in repository settings → Problem solved! 🎉
