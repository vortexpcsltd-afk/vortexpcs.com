# ðŸš€ Deploy Now - Fixed!

## âœ… Merge Conflict Fixed

The Git merge conflict in `vite.config.ts` has been resolved.

## Push These Changes

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit the fix
git commit -m "Fix vite.config.ts merge conflict"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin master
```

Vercel will automatically deploy in ~2 minutes.

## What Was Wrong

You had Git merge conflict markers in `vite.config.ts`:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
[some code]
=======
[other code]
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

These markers broke the build because they're not valid TypeScript.

## After Pushing

1. âœ… Vercel will auto-detect the push
2. âœ… Build will start automatically
3. âœ… Should complete in ~2 minutes
4. âœ… Site will be live!

## Monitor the Build

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Watch the "Deployments" tab
4. Build logs should show: âœ… "Build Completed"

## Success = You'll See

âœ… Deep blue gradient background  
âœ… VortexPCs logo in navigation  
âœ… "Custom PC in 5 Days" hero text  
âœ… Frosted glass cards with proper styling  
âœ… Small yellow stars (not black giants!)  
âœ… Cyan/blue gradient buttons  
âœ… Fully responsive layout  

## If It STILL Shows Layout Issues

The Tailwind CSS might not be compiling. Try this nuclear option:

### Switch to Tailwind v3 (More Stable)

```bash
# Remove Tailwind v4
npm uninstall tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite

# Install v3
npm install -D tailwindcss@3.4.17 postcss@8.4.49 autoprefixer@10.4.20

# Initialize config
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Then update these files:

**vite.config.ts** - Remove Tailwind plugin:
```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  // ... rest stays same
});
```

**tailwind.config.js** - Create this new file:
```js
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

**styles/globals.css** - Change first line to:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Then:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Downgrade to Tailwind v3 for stability"
git push origin master
```

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

If you're still stuck after this, the issue might be:
- Cached build on Vercel (clear cache and redeploy)
- Node version (set to 18 or 20 in Vercel settings)
- Missing environment variables

But this fix should work! ðŸŽ‰
